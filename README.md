DS Homebrew Mario's Cement factory Game and Watch

=== INTRODUCTION ===

In 1984 I got my second ‘handheld’ console: the G&W Mario's Cement factory. And now I programmed this version for the DS homebrew.

This is the result and I hope you like it.

Some information:

Gameplay identical to the Game & Watch Mario's Cement Factory.
Each level becomes gradually more difficult: more carts carrying cement and more missing elevator steps
Background graphic 'borrowed' from 'Game and Watch Gallery 4'.
All other graphics created from a picture taken from my G&W Mario's Cement Factory.
All sounds recorded from a playing session with my G&W Mario's Cement Factory.
[ Yes, my G&W Mario's Cement Factory handheld is still working !]

The game is created using devkitpro: https://devkitpro.org/. Good introduction tutorials to using devkitpro and DS programming: https://patater.com/files/projects/manual/manual.html

=== HOW TO INSTALL AND START THE GAME USING THE DS WITH R4DS ===

It is as simple as putting the mariocement.nds on the SD card.
Put the SD card back in the R4DS card.
Put the R4DS card back in the Nintendo DS.
Start the Mario's Cement Factory homebrew application.
