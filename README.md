## INTRODUCTION

In 1984 I got my second ‘handheld’ console: the G&W Mario's Cement factory. And now I programmed this version for the DS homebrew.

This is the result and I hope you like it.

A video showing the game can be found on YouTube:

Some information:

- Gameplay identical to the Game & Watch Mario's Cement Factory.
- Each level becomes gradually more difficult: more carts carrying cement and more missing elevator steps
- Background graphic 'borrowed' from 'Game and Watch Gallery 4'.
- All other graphics created from a picture taken from my G&W Mario's Cement Factory.
- All sounds recorded from a playing session with my G&W Mario's Cement Factory.

[ Yes, my G&W Mario's Cement Factory handheld is still working !]

The game is created using devkitpro:

## HOW TO PLAY THE GAME IN AN EMULATOR

The game can be played with the DeSmuME Nintendo DS emulator: [desmume.org](https://desmume.org/).

The DeSmuME emulator is also a core in RetroArch so it is possible to play the game with RetroArch: [retroarch.com](https://www.retroarch.com/).

In the emulator you need to place the 'Game & Watch Donkey Kong Jr.nds' rom in the appropriate rom-folder.

> [!NOTE]
> I'm not providing detailed information on how to download, setup and configure the emulators. This information changes often with new releases of the emulators. It is best to consult the emulator's official websites for more information.

> [!TIP]
> You might also need to provide the generic NDS BIOS files (bios7.bin, bios9.bin and firmware.bin) to the emulator.

When you play the game with RetroArch, it is also possible to get [Retro Achievements](https://retroachievements.org/game/30911) for the game.
