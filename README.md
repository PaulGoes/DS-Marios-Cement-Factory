## INTRODUCTION

In 1984 I got my second ‘handheld’ console: the G&W Mario's Cement factory. And now I programmed this version for the DS homebrew.

This is the result and I hope you like it.

A video showing the game can be found on YouTube:

Some information:

- Gameplay identical to the Game & Watch Mario's Cement Factory.
- Each level becomes gradually more difficult: more carts carrying cement and more missing elevator steps
- Background graphic 'borrowed' from 'Game and Watch Gallery 4'.
- All other graphics created from a picture taken from my G&W Mario's Cement Factory.
- All sounds recorded from a playing session with my G&W Mario's Cement Factory.

[ Yes, my G&W Mario's Cement Factory handheld is still working !]

The game is created using devkitpro:
